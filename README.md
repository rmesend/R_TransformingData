Transforming Data

Visualizations are extremely helpful but rarely do we find data in the right format to create the plots that we need. We will need to sort, create new variables or calculate summary statistics, these transformations make your data easier to work with.

There are 6 basic dplyr functions that will help you in your data transformation.

filter()
arrange()
select()
mutate()
summarise()
group_by()
